# ZeeMaji's Custom objects for OpenRCT2
Contains my custom objects for OpenRCT2

./packed contains pre-built parkobjs for direct use with openrct2.
./objects contains the sources used to build these objects.

Special thanks to poke (Pokemanic33#0840 on the openrct2 discord) for creating the original tarmac surface, all of their efforts are seen in the zeemajora.terrain_surface.poke_tarmac_etc... objects.
